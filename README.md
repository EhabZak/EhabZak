### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer based in the beautiful Bay Area, California. I recently graduated from the App Academy bootcamp, and I'm excited to tell you a bit about myself. I have a real passion for software engineering, and I love solving challenging problems. One of my strengths is that I'm adaptable and a quick learner, which I believe is crucial in the ever-evolving tech world. I'm a team player and thrive on collaborating with experienced professionals. 

My skill set is quite diverse, and I'm well-versed in various programming languages, including JavaScript and Python. I also have experience with a wide range of web development tools and technologies like React, Redux, Flask, HTML, CSS, and more. When it comes to databases, I've worked with RDBMS. I'm also familiar with tools like AWS S3, Git, Visual Studio Code, and Jira, which are essential for efficient project development.

In my project experience, I've had the opportunity to showcase my technical skills. One of my projects, "Yap," is a PERN stack web application inspired by Yelp, and another one, "YummyEats," is inspired by UberEats. These projects demonstrate my ability to integrate various technologies, optimize website performance, and create outstanding user experiences. Beyond that, my work experience as a Projects Manager at A.D General Services Company in the UAE and as a Project Manager at Suraj Group of Companies in Surrey, BC, has honed my project management and communication skills.

I completed my Full Stack Web Development program at App Academy in October 2023. Prior to that, I earned a Master of Engineering Leadership in Clean Energy from The University of British Columbia in 2016. With a strong technical foundation and a deep passion for software engineering, I'm ready to bring my skills and dedication to your team. Let's work together to tackle exciting challenges and create innovative solutions.
